You have a string A = A1A2...An consisting of lowercase English letters only.
You are allowed to choose any two indices i and j such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n and reverse substring AiAi+1...Aj.
You can perform this operation atmost once.
You can choose to not perform this operation at all.
How many different strings can you obtain?

INPUT
Input consists of a single string A

OUTPUT
Print the number of different strings you can obtain by reversing any substring in A at most once.

CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ |A| ≤ 200,000
